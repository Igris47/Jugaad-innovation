In this research paper, we have explored the concept of jugaad innovation and its awareness among educated residents of Kolkata. Jugaad, originating from India, embodies a unique approach to problem-solving characterized by resourcefulness, improvisation, and a mindset of doing more with less. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and case studies, we have gained valuable insights into the nature, principles, and applications of jugaad innovation. 
 
Our primary research findings highlight several key points: 
When we embarked on a journey to find out about the consumer awareness on jugaad innovation among educated residents of Kolkata we realized that there is still room for educating Kolkata residents about jugaad innovation. Further, we found that limited funding is the main barrier in adopting jugaad innovation. This is interesting because jugaad innovation works well under conditions of resource constraint and limited funding. We also found that there is scope for arranging workshops and/or seminars on jugaad innovation in Kolkata. We also found that according to our respondents, transportation, healthcare and energy are the three most promising sectors where Jugaad Innovation can be employed. Interestingly, a large portion of our respondents are willing to embrace Jugaad Innovation in the future. 
 
Our secondary research yielded the following insights: 
Firstly, jugaad innovation represents a grassroots approach to innovation that thrives in resource-constrained environments. It emphasizes the importance of creativity and resilience in overcoming challenges and finding simple yet effective solutions to complex problems. Secondly, the principles of jugaad have broader implications beyond developing countries. Organizations worldwide are increasingly embracing jugaad-inspired practices to foster agility, flexibility, and cost-efficiency in innovation processes. 
 
Furthermore, we have identified the potential drawbacks and criticisms associated with jugaad, including concerns about sustainability, quality, and scalability. While jugaad offers quick fixes and immediate solutions, its longterm viability and impact on sustainable development warrant careful consideration. Moving forward, our research underscores the need for a balanced approach that combines the strengths of jugaad with structured innovation frameworks. By integrating jugaad principles with formal innovation processes, organizations can harness the benefits of both frugality and rigor to drive sustainable innovation. 
 
In conclusion, the study of jugaad innovation offers valuable lessons for entrepreneurs, managers, policymakers, and researchers alike. Embracing jugaad's spirit of ingenuity and resilience can inspire innovative thinking and foster inclusive growth in diverse contexts. However, it is essential to approach jugaad with a critical lens, recognizing its strengths while addressing its limitations for sustainable and responsible innovation. As we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world, understanding and leveraging the principles of jugaad innovation can pave the way for transformative solutions that address pressing societal and environmental challenges. 
 
This research paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on jugaad innovation.  innovation. We hope that our findings stimulate further research and practical applications that harness the power of jugaad innovation to create positive impact and meaningful change.
